TiddlyJam is designed to make it easy to export a simple blog from TW5 while providing the tools to make very complex websites.

!! How to setup
* Make sure TiddlyWiki on NodeJS is installed and upgraded to the latest version as instructed by https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted%20-%20Node.js.
** `tiddlywiki --version` should print `5.1.23`
** TiddlyJam needs the nodejs installation of TiddlyWiki to work properly (for now). Checkout the github repo (https://github.com/ThaddeusJiang/tiddlyjam) for more details on future plans.
* Open the local folder containing the wiki in file explorer:
**Replace your `tiddlywiki.info` file with the one here: https://github.com/ThaddeusJiang/tiddlyjam/blob/main/tiddlywiki.info
*Open your wiki in the browser and import the plugin from https://thaddeusjiang.github.io/tiddlyjam/wiki (you can drag and drop it into your wiki)
**In your wiki, `TiddlyJam Dashboard` should be now available to manage your website.

!! How to Export
*Open the command line, navigate to the local folder of your TW5 and run: `tiddlywiki --build tiddlyjam`
* The `output` folder should contain the html files. It will be rendered using the default theme - the same one as [[https://thaddeusjiang.github.io/tiddlyjam]]
** This folder can be hosted on your hosting service and viola - the website is ready.
