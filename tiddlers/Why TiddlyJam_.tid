title: Why TiddlyJam?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Why does this exist? Why did someone feel the need to make another static website generator?

I started using [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] more than 5 years back as a note-keeping device. I found myself enamoured (still am) by its elegant structure and its premise of maintenance-free all-in-one software (its also a [[quine|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)]]!). 

In 2020, during the lockdowns, I wanted to create a website/blog for myself and thought - TiddlyWiki has a great template engine - why not create one using that? Thanks to several great resources like https://www.didaxy.com/ and https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-tiddlywiki, I was able to create my website at https://adithyab.in in a fairly short time. 

Keeping with the spirit of TiddlyWiki, I am open-sourcing my work in TiddlyJam. Now, its yours too :)
